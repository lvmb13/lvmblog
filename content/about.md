I'm Lvmb. I am based and redpilled gamer, and also humble zoomer. I am from Korea somewhere. Yes, I do speak Korean. That's why you see this hipster languages all around. And no, I have no opinion on KPOP and I am not going to write my words in Korean and English at every single same time. I will shitpost different subjects in different languages. So bring your google translator, stay with me, or die.

This is my website, which in MIT cucking fking license. Do you see the copyright sign at the bottom? That was not my intention to put it there. Can't fully customize it. I hate copyrights. I can't even divide the columns into multiple categories. Unironically I can do only literal shitpost with no categories. But currently this is the best for my workflow with R markdown.  

The list of links below is my contact information.

# Background 배경

I am interested in... "memes"... Cringe? I know saying the word "meme" is cringe but I have no other way to explain it. The point is, I came across the memes for both of Yankees and Koreans and I noticed that the whole living things in Korea, the trends, the education, the politics, the consumerism, become degenerate. I know the world is a big fat joke. Everybody feels that the world is burning hell. But the difference is, Korea is a small world and there is no way out. It's like Hong Kong, your equity value is overestimated and there is nowhere to sellout. Koreans were used to be "OK". Now there is no break point; no one is complaining that shit's being cringe! There is no counter. People think that being cool is being edgier. They worship slave morals ~~like~~. That is not based. That is not redpilled. Enough is enough. They are missing the point! They don't know what does the endgame looks like. They don't get it, the thing. yOu know, You know duh duh duh thing you know? So I needed rightful place to share my honest opinions and this was the first reason why I created this website. 

I am working on the libertarian movement in Korea. Only Austro, no homo. Before you make fun of  me being  lolbertarian, think about this first: every great thinkers and reactionaries were libertarians. Freedom is the first step for redpilling. I am going to archive things that not introduced in Korea. I found that some foreign literature that deserve to be noticed are totally forgotten or not even introduced to the public. As result, the whole system contributed to brainwashing NPCs. KOR NPCs are even worse; they are basically neocon brainlets or reddit tier skeptics. So called intellectual gurus read some Friedman and Foucault and say shit about our ancient wisdom. At the end, they all praise our greatest, liberal democracy. Unironically we Koreans got cucked by West, ha ha... No more ethos here, only by-products. 

I mainly use the two web forums. I use [Libertarianism board](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/lists/?id=libertarianism) at DcInside and I am a moderator here. DcInside is the most popular forum in Korea. Otherwise, I use this forum, (https://www.encyclopedia.zone/rums). This is my [profile](https://www.encyclopedia.zone/rums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=53). The guys here are tapped in, very classic. I like small cults.

Please contact me if you have cool literature to share or being interested to collab with Korean libertarian scene.
